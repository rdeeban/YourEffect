Nicholas McNew and I created this website for the Business Professionals of America National Competition Web Applications Team Event. We placed 4th in the nation and were recognized on stage (received medals). 

The purpose of this website is to give our clients feedback on how they can reduce energy costs by using energy-efficient household appliances.

The Website can be found at:
